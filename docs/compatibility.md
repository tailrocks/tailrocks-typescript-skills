# Compatibility

This record covers each client and route. The default outcome is
unverified. Each unverified row names its reason. A route is never
unsupported only because its binary is absent. A route is never
verified only because a different client accepted the same files.

No installation check ran for this revision yet. The marketplace and
local-path rows stay open until the Phase E checks execute them. No
model task ran and no skill executed.

## User-only enforcement

This table records documented support, not runtime verification.
Enforced means the client blocks automatic model invocation of the
ten user-only skills. Limited means the client documents the
frontmatter but cannot enforce it.

| Client | Entry for the ten skills |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Enforced (`disable-model-invocation`). |
| Codex | Enforced (`allow_implicit_invocation: false`). |
| Kimi Code | Enforced (`disableModelInvocation`). |
| Grok Build | Enforced (`disable-model-invocation`). |
| Amp | Limited: lists every skill to the model. |
| Antigravity | Limited: frontmatter holds `name` and `description` only. |
| Muse Code | Limited: recall observer can surface skills. |
| OpenCode V1 | Gated by `permission.skill: ask`. |

## Static fit

These facts were observed on 2026-10-07 from the package files. They
are not install proofs:

- All twelve frontmatter names match their skill directories.
- All names are 36 characters or less. All descriptions are 289
  characters or less. The Amp, OpenCode, and Kimi caps fit.
- The root manifest carries the Agent Plugins 1.0.0 schema id.
- The Kimi manifest sets `skills` to `./skills/`.
- Every payload file under `skills/` is text. No file carries the
  executable bit.
- The `scripts/` helpers resolve inside the package: the resolver
  import and the harness path stay under the package root.
