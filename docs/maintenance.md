# Maintenance

## Verify commands

Run each command from the repository root. Every command must exit 0.

Structure check:

```sh
alint check
```

Expected result: no errors. The check enforces required paths,
manifest agreement, README sections, skill-id shape, and the ban on
component catalogs.

Strict-JSON check. It rejects comments, trailing commas, and
duplicate keys in the three manifests:

```sh
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json
FILES = ["plugin.json", ".claude-plugin/plugin.json", ".kimi-plugin/plugin.json"]
def hook(pairs):
    seen = set()
    for key, _ in pairs:
        if key in seen:
            raise ValueError("duplicate key: " + key)
        seen.add(key)
    return dict(pairs)
for path in FILES:
    with open(path) as handle:
        json.load(handle, object_pairs_hook=hook)
    print("OK " + path)
EOF
```

Expected result: one `OK` line per manifest.

Frontmatter and ID check. It verifies the frontmatter block, the
name key, name and directory agreement, id charset, and the
description key for each skill:

```sh
python3 - <<'EOF'
import glob, os, re, sys
found = sorted(glob.glob("skills/*/SKILL.md"))
errors = []
for path in found:
    skill_id = path.split(os.sep)[1]
    text = open(path).read()
    match = re.match(r"---\n(.*?)\n---\n", text, re.S)
    if not match:
        errors.append(path + ": missing frontmatter block")
        continue
    front = match.group(1)
    name = re.search(r"^name:\s*(\S+)\s*$", front, re.M)
    if not name:
        errors.append(path + ": missing name key")
        continue
    if name.group(1) != skill_id:
        errors.append(path + ": name does not match directory")
    if not re.fullmatch(r"[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*", name.group(1)):
        errors.append(path + ": invalid skill id")
    if not re.search(r"^description:", front, re.M):
        errors.append(path + ": missing description key")
if errors:
    print("\n".join(errors))
    sys.exit(1)
print("OK %d skills: names match, ids valid, descriptions present"
      % len(found))
EOF
```

Expected result: `OK 12 skills` plus the verified-facts summary.

Markdown check:

```sh
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2@0.23.3 "**/*.md"
```

Expected result: no issues in authored files. The version is
pinned. There is no shared markdownlint config yet, so the check
uses default rules. Generated files under `.github/` carry findings
owned by the generator.

Native validator probes (read-only, no install):

```sh
claude plugin validate ./
muse plugins validate ./ --json
muse skills validate ./skills/tailrocks-typescript-review
```

Expected result, observed 2026-10-07: `claude plugin validate`
passes with one author warning (the host manifest carries name,
version, and description only, per the common structure).
`muse plugins validate` reports `valid: true`. It finds all twelve
skills through the portable root manifest. It lists warnings only:
unrecognized `disableModelInvocation` frontmatter keys, inactive
`.claude-plugin` overlay fields beside the authoritative root, and
the generated `.github/CLAUDE.md` symlink. `muse skills validate`
reports valid.

Known tension: `claude plugin validate --strict` exits 1 because it
promotes the author warning to an error. Plain validation passes,
so the package installs. Do not add `author` to the host manifest
as a local fix: that breaks the common structure. Resolve the
tension in the common design instead.

Generation diff. It proves `.github/` matches the generator output:

```sh
velnor-actions generate --output-dir /private/tmp/velnor-preview
diff -r .github /private/tmp/velnor-preview
```

Expected result: empty diff. Restore
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` after each regenerate until the
generator preserves it. See the CI source section below.

## Policy version and update

- alint: v0.17.0.
- Shared profile: `standards/alint/active.yml` at
  tailrocks-skills commit
  `d54adec8f3188962cdd2b8298350d24114b87079`.
- Pin:
  `sha256-80c782b168658bbfb10aa01f43712435ef20313f5af22ffaddd6b08256b22616`.
- markdownlint-cli2: 0.23.3.

Bump the pin in one pull request: update the REV and HASH together
in `.alint.yml`, regenerate, and re-run every verify command.

## CI source and regeneration

`.velnor/config.toml` is the source. `velnor-actions generate` writes
`.github/` from it. Never hand-edit `.github/` as the fix for a
workflow problem. Change the config and regenerate.

Known gap: the generator replaces the full `.github/` tree and drops
hand-placed files. The required `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
is hand-placed. After each regenerate, confirm the file still
exists. Restore it from version control when the generator removed
it. Remove this paragraph after the generator preserve change lands
and the template survives a regenerate.

## Release and migration

Release in this order:

1. Tag the release commit.
2. Resolve the exact commit SHA of the tag.
3. Bump the `rev` of this plugin in the central catalog at
   `tailrocks/tailrocks-skills`.
4. Regenerate the native catalogs from the central source.
5. Re-run every verify command.
6. Publish the tag.

Migrate installs per the agent procedures in `installation.md`.
Uninstall each plugin per scope, remove the old marketplace, add the
new marketplace, and install the plugin. The order prevents
duplicates.

## Prohibited evaluation content

Never add evaluation content to skills, references, templates, task
definitions, or CI. This ban covers behavioral benchmarks, trigger
precision and recall, repeated model trials, and scored wording
comparisons. It also covers model-family matrices, pressure
scenarios, holdout datasets, and judge or grader models. It also
covers pass-rate targets, token and latency comparisons, mandatory
failing baselines, and task trials under any name. Do not relabel
such work as smoke, pressure, or compatibility checks. A sample
task never proves behavior.

Before aggregate commands, read each task definition and strip
evaluation steps. Never trust the command name. To find violations,
search case-insensitively for `benchmark`, `trigger precision`,
`trigger recall`, `model trial`, `scored output`, `model-family`,
`pressure scenario`, `holdout`, `judge`, `grader`, `pass-rate`, and
`task trial`. Before a change, read the text before and after the
term: a prohibition or a historical explanation is not an active
requirement.
