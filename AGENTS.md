# AGENTS.md

This package holds twelve TypeScript, TanStack, and web skills.
Install it as one unit. Do not copy one `SKILL.md` file out of its
skill directory.

## Structure

- `plugin.json` is the portable manifest. It is the source of truth
  for name, version, and description.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json` are
  host manifests. They repeat the same name, version, and description.
- `skills/` holds one directory per skill id. Each directory holds its
  own `SKILL.md` file plus its own references.
- `scripts/` holds necessary runtime helpers: the version resolver
  support files and the visual-QA harness. Skills reference them.
  Do not remove a referenced helper.
- `docs/` holds the package guides. Start at `docs/README.md`.

## Rules for changes

- Write all new and changed prose in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical
  English, Issue 9 rules.
- Label Tailrocks architecture choices as Tailrocks choices. Bun,
  TanStack, GraphQL, and Rust ownership are house selections. They are
  not universal TypeScript rules.
- Never hand-edit `.github/`. Change `.velnor/config.toml` and
  regenerate. Restore `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` after each
  regenerate until the generator preserves it.
- Never add evaluation content: no benchmarks, no model trials, no
  scored comparisons, no pass-rate targets. See `docs/maintenance.md`.
- Keep one fact in one place. Link to `docs/` guides. Do not copy
  skill bodies into guides.
